Alright here we go with the running of this model...

Step 1: Energy mixes 
```{r}
# set up a results data frame to write successful results 
results <- data.frame(matrix(ncol=4,nrow=1000))

## set a counter variable
x <-1 

## set up a repeater function so it goes until a condition is met
repeat({
  
  ## sample integer between 0 and 100 -- if certain energy sources have limits can define the range in the sample() function
  s <- sample(0:3,1)
  w <- sample(0:7,1)
  b <- sample(0:70,1)
  h <- sample(0:26,1)
  
  ## find the sum of the mix
  s <- c(s, w, b, h)
  ssum <- sum(s)
  
  ## write the mix if it equals 100
  if (ssum==100){
    results[x,1:4]<-s
    
    ## increase the counter to keep track of successful mixes
    x<-x+1}
  
  ## break after 100 mixes written
  if (x>1000){
    break}
  
})
```
These results seem pretty similar let's try another one where we vary the energy sources more even if that's unrealistic.
